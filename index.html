            <p>San Francisco’s first public park and historical center of modern San Francisco. Portsmouth square has served as a rallying point for protests centered on Asian American rights from the Civil Rights Movement through the Stop Asian Hate organizing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Beneath the shadow of thousands of Single Room Occupancy units, Portsmouth Square is often referred to as the “living room of Chinatown.” The groups gathered daily in the park reflect the product of a long history of anti-Chinese legislation, limited housing and restricted economic development.</p>

            <p>The International Hotel (aka I-Hotel) was a low income, single-room-occupancy residential hotel that came to embody the struggle for civil rights and social justice in 1960’s Chinatown. Mainly occupied by elderly Asian Americans, including a large contingent of Filipino Americans, the hotel was targeted for demolition and development by corporate real estate developers. The threat of displacing hundreds of low-income occupants drew protestors that included housing activists, students, community members and tenants, to the hotel. This nine-year struggle to save the I-Hotel made national news as a concrete example of solidarity between cultures and ethnic groups that can inspire and educate us.</p>

            <p>The gang-related shooting at the Golden Dragon Restaurant on September 4, 1977 marked a flashpoint in Chinatown’s history. Up until that point, the City of San Francisco was mainly content to let Chinatown police itself with little intervention from City Hall. Underlying tension in Chinatown arose from a new wave of immigrants moving into Chinatown. Subsequently creating an economic rivalry with existing residents during the 1970’s. The shooting claimed the lives of five people and injured eleven others. The victims were mainly innocent bystanders and tourists. The event gained national notoriety and external pressure forever changed policing in Chinatown with the creation of the Asian Gang Task Force.</p>
